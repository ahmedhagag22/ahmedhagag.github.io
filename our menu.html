                A mix of freshly grilled fish and assorted vegetables with a savoury lemon sauce are amongst the things that are

                A delicious selection of chicken that has been cooked to perfection a week prior to
                serving, all done to absorb the moisture of the surroundings and make the chicken very
                moist.

            <p class = "description">
                A perfectly cooked beef served with a side of mashed potato that will leave you
                wondering about what sort of animal the beef comes from and the source of the 
                zesty flavour of the sauce that is unlike anything you have tasted before.
